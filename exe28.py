# Exercise 28:Wind Chill

# When the wind blows in cold weather, the air feels even colder than it actually is
# because the movement of the air increases the rate of cooling for warm objects, like
# people. This effect is known as wind chill.
# In 2001, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States adopted the following
# formula for computing the wind chill index. Within the formula Ta is the
# air temperature in degrees Celsius and V is the wind speed in kilometers per hour.
# A similar formula with different constant values can be used with temperatures in
# degrees Fahrenheit and wind speeds in miles per hour.
# WCI = 13.12 + 0.6215Ta âˆ’ 11.37V0.16 + 0.3965TaV0.16
# Write a program that begins by reading the air temperature and wind speed from the
# user. Once these values have been read your program should display the wind chill
# index rounded to the closest integer.
# The wind chill index is only considered valid for temperatures less than or
# equal to 10 degrees Celsius and wind speeds exceeding 4.8 kilometers per
# hour.

temp = float(input("Enter air temperature: "))
wind_speed = float(input("Enter wind speed: "))
wci = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temp - 11.37 * (wind_speed ** 0.16) + 0.3965 * temp * (wind_speed ** 0.16)
print("Wind chill index = ", wci)
