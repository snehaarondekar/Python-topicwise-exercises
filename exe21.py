# Exercise 21:Area of a Triangle
#
# The area of a triangle can be computed using the following formula, where b is the
# length of the base of the triangle, and h is its height:
# area = (b Ã— h)/2
# Write a program that allows the user to enter values for b and h. The program
# should then compute and display the area of a triangle with base length b and height h.

base = float(input("Enter base of the Triangle :"))
height = float(input("Enter Height of the Triangle :"))
print("Area of Triangle with base", base,"and height", height,"=",(base*height)/2)
