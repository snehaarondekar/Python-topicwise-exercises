# Exercise 44: Date to Holiday Name
# Canada has three national holidays which fall on the same dates each year.
# Holiday Date
# New year’s day January 1
# Canada day July 1
# Christmas day December 25
# Write a program that reads a month and day from the user. If the month and day
# match one of the holidays listed previously then your program should display the
# holiday’s name. Otherwise your program should indicate that the entered month and
# day do not correspond to a fixed-date holiday.
# Canada has two additional national holidays, Good Friday and Labour Day,
# whose dates vary from year to year. There are also numerous provincial and
# territorial holidays, some of which have fixed dates, and some of which have
# variable dates. We will not consider any of these additional holidays in this
# exercise.
